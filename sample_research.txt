    Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with far-reaching impacts on ecosystems, 
    weather patterns, and human societies. Rising global temperatures, primarily caused by greenhouse gas emissions, 
    are leading to more frequent and severe weather events, including hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves. 
    
    The Arctic is warming at more than twice the global average rate, resulting in rapid ice melt and rising sea levels. 
    This not only threatens coastal communities but also disrupts marine ecosystems and weather patterns worldwide. 
    
    Climate change also affects biodiversity, with many species struggling to adapt to changing conditions. 
    Coral reefs, for example, are experiencing widespread bleaching due to warmer ocean temperatures and acidification.
    
    Mitigation strategies include transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, 
    and implementing carbon capture technologies. Adaptation measures are equally important, such as building 
    climate-resilient infrastructure and developing drought-resistant crops.
    
    International cooperation through agreements like the Paris Agreement is crucial for addressing this 
    global challenge. However, current commitments fall short of what's needed to limit global warming to 1.5Â°C 
    above pre-industrial levels, as recommended by climate scientists.
