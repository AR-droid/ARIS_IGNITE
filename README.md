ARIS - Advanced Research Innovative Solution
Overview

ARIS is an AI-powered research assistant designed to streamline the process of academic research, analysis, and knowledge dissemination. It integrates advanced AI models, blockchain, and automation tools to provide a comprehensive platform for discovering, analyzing, and generating insights from research papers.

Features

Research Paper Retrieval: Fetch research articles from CORE API and other academic repositories.

Smart Summarization: Multi-level AI summarization (beginner to expert) for quick knowledge access.

Video Generation: Automatic conversion of research insights into explainer videos with AI voiceovers and animations.

Structure Generation: Auto-generate research structures (abstract, methodology, results, conclusion) from raw papers.

Neural Network-based Insights: Use advanced deep learning models to identify trends, correlations, and predictions across domains.

Blockchain Integration: Ensure provenance, authorship validation, and transparent peer-review mechanisms.

SingularityNET Integration: Leverage decentralized AI services for scalability and multi-agent collaboration.

Automation Pipelines: End-to-end workflows for literature review, citation extraction, and knowledge graph creation.

Knowledge Graphs: Visual mapping of research concepts, citations, and relationships between ideas.

Collaborative Workspace: Shared dashboards for researchers, educators, and institutions.

System Architecture (High-Level)

Frontend: Interactive web dashboard with visualization and video playback support.

Backend: Flask/FastAPI + Python AI pipelines for paper retrieval, NLP, and video generation.

AI Modules: Neural networks for summarization, classification, citation analysis, and video generation.

Blockchain Layer: Smart contracts for authentication, ownership, and peer review.

SingularityNET Services: Decentralized AI for scaling computations and multi-agent research tasks.

Database: Hybrid storage (SQL + NoSQL) with research metadata, papers, and processed content.
